\title{Daily Temperatures for Honolulu and New York City (1995-2020)}
\format{
`hnl_nyc_temps` is a tibble with 18,530 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
  \item{city}{City name: "Honolulu" or "New York City"}
  \item{date}{Date of observation}
  \item{temp}{Average daily temperature (°F), with some missing values}
  \item{temp_imputed}{Temperature with missing values imputed via moving average}
  \item{year}{Year of observation}
}
}
\source{
Weather station data obtained from NOAA.
}
\usage{
hnl_nyc_temps
}
\description{
Daily average temperatures (°F) recorded at Honolulu, Hawaii and 
New York City, New York from January 1, 1995 through May 13, 2020.
}
\details{
The dataset contains 9,265 daily observations for each city. Missing values
(18 for Honolulu, 20 for New York City) were imputed using a moving average
method via \code{imputeTS::na_ma()}. The \code{temp} column preserves the
original missing values; the \code{temp_imputed} column provides the
imputed series suitable for spectrum estimation and other analyses
requiring complete data.

Honolulu temperatures have mean 77°F with standard deviation 3.4°F.
New York City temperatures have mean 56°F with standard deviation 17.1°F.
The contrast illustrates how climate differs between tropical and 
mid-latitude locations: Honolulu is warmer and far less variable.
