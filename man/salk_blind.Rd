\description{
Results from the 1954 Salk polio vaccine field trial using a
randomized controlled double-blind design.
}
\details{
In this design, children whose parents consented were randomly assigned
to receive either the vaccine (treatment) or a placebo (control), with
neither the children nor the evaluating physicians knowing which was
which (double-blind). Children whose parents did not consent were
tracked separately.

Compare with \code{\link{salk_nfip}} for the alternative observed-control
design used in some areas.
