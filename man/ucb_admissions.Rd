\description{
Admission decisions for applicants to six graduate departments at
UC Berkeley in 1973, a classic example of Simpson's paradox.
}
\details{
Overall, men had a higher admission rate than women (44\% vs. 35\%),
suggesting possible discrimination. However, examining each department
separately reveals that women had equal or higher admission rates in
most departments. The paradox arises because women applied
disproportionately to more competitive departments with lower
admission rates.

This is a tidy conversion of \code{datasets::UCBAdmissions}.
