\description{
Predictions for the 1936 U.S. presidential election from the Literary
Digest poll and Gallup, compared with the actual election result.
}
\details{
The Literary Digest had correctly predicted every presidential election
since 1916, but famously failed in 1936 by predicting Alf Landon would
defeat Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Digest mailed questionnaires to 10
million people drawn from telephone directories and automobile
registration lists—sources that over-represented wealthier voters who
favored Landon. George Gallup, using a smaller but more representative
sample, correctly predicted both the election outcome and what the
biased Digest poll would find.
