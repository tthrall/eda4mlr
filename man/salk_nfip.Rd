\description{
Results from the 1954 Salk polio vaccine field trial using the
NFIP observed-control design.
}
\details{
In this design, second-graders whose parents consented received the
vaccine (treatment), while first- and third-graders served as the
control group. This is an observed-control rather than randomized
design, and is subject to confounding because parental consent was
associated with higher socioeconomic status, which was in turn
associated with higher polio rates.

Compare with \code{\link{salk_blind}} for the randomized controlled
double-blind design used in other areas.
