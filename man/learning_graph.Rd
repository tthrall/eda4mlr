\description{
A multi-relational knowledge graph representing the data science skills
ecosystem, designed for demonstrating graph theory concepts in machine
learning applications.

\section{Schema}{

The LearningGraph schema defines permissible node types, edge types, and
their constraints. Access it via \code{learning_graph$metadata$schema}.

\tabular{lllll}{
  \strong{Edge Type} \tab \strong{Source} \tab \strong{Target} \tab \strong{Property} \tab \strong{Semantics} \cr
  has_skill \tab learner \tab skill \tab proficiency \tab current_level \cr
  requires_skill \tab work_role \tab skill \tab proficiency \tab minimum_threshold \cr
  prerequisite \tab skill \tab skill \tab - \tab - \cr
  teaches \tab course \tab skill \tab proficiency \tab maximum_ceiling \cr
  skill_in_competency \tab skill \tab competency \tab - \tab -
}

Note that proficiency appears in three edge types with different semantics:
\itemize{
  \item \code{has_skill}: Current state (where the learner stands now)
  \item \code{requires_skill}: Threshold (minimum acceptable level for role)
  \item \code{teaches}: Ceiling (maximum level the course can develop)
}

The \code{prerequisite} edge carries no proficiency property. This is a
deliberate design choice: conceptual dependencies between skills are stable
regardless of proficiency level.

The \code{skill_in_competency} relationship is normalized into the skills
table via the \code{cmp_id} column rather than stored as a separate edge
table, since each skill belongs to exactly one competency.
}

\section{Graph Structure}{

The LearningGraph demonstrates several graph types:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{DAG}: The prerequisite edges form a directed acyclic graph
  \item \strong{Bipartite}: Learner-Skill and Course-Skill relationships
  \item \strong{Weighted}: Proficiency levels as edge weights
  \item \strong{Multi-relational}: Multiple edge types between node types
}

  \item \strong{Bipartite}: Learner-Skill and Course-Skill relationships
  \item \strong{Weighted}: Proficiency levels as edge weights
  \item \strong{Multi-relational}: Multiple edge types between node types
}
}

\section{Demonstrated Algorithms}{

\itemize{
  \item \strong{Shortest path}: Find minimal learning sequence between skills
  \item \strong{Gap analysis}: Compare current vs. required skill profiles
  \item \strong{Community detection}: Skills cluster by competency area
  \item \strong{Centrality}: Identify foundational vs. advanced skills
  \item \strong{Topological sort}: Determine valid learning orderings
}

\section{Temporal Considerations}{

The LearningGraph as provided is a snapshot: it captures the state of
learners, courses, and requirements at a moment in time. A production
system would need temporal constraints governing valid state transitions.
For example, demonstrated proficiency should not decrease without
reassessment. Such temporal extensions are left as an exercise.
