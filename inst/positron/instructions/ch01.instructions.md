# Chapter 1: Exploratory Data Analysis

## Chapter Scope and Position

Chapter 1 is the conceptual foundation for the entire book. It introduces
EDA not as a technique but as a *stance* toward data—a willingness to look
before modeling, to ask questions before testing hypotheses. The chapter
establishes the Tukey tradition that runs through all 15 chapters and
introduces the core vocabulary (central tendency, dispersion, conditional
distributions) that later chapters formalize and extend.

**The intellectual context:** Tukey promoted data analysis precisely to
counter a movement at prominent universities (Berkeley being a leading
example) toward mathematical statistics as an abstract mathematical
discipline. Mathematics is grounded in logical deduction and values
concision; data analysis is inherently inferential and inductive, and
requires the student to make real-world sense out of data. Students
with strong mathematical training may find the open-ended, question-driven
nature of EDA uncomfortable. This discomfort is legitimate and worth
acknowledging, not a misunderstanding to be corrected. In hypothesis
testing, for instance, sufficient data may detect a departure from the
null that is statistically significant without being practically
significant. EDA invites students to develop cognitive skills that
differ from those valued in pure mathematics, and the chapter should be
understood in that light.

**Assumed background:** Basic familiarity with R and the tidyverse at the
level of R for Data Science chapters 1–4. No prior statistics coursework
is required; the chapter builds from first principles.

**Where it leads:** Chapter 2 (Conditional Distributions) takes the
father-son scatter plot from this chapter and develops it into the graph
of averages, the regression line, and the correlation coefficient. The
conditional box plots in this chapter are the visual precursor to the
formal treatment of conditional expectation in Chapter 2.

## Learning Objectives

The student should be able to:

1. Distinguish between exploratory and confirmatory data analysis and
   explain when each is appropriate.
2. Select appropriate measures of central tendency (mean, median) and
   dispersion (SD, IQR) based on data characteristics.
3. Construct basic visualizations: histograms, scatter diagrams, and
   box plots.
4. Interpret scatter plots, box plots, and histograms to identify
   patterns, outliers, and distributional shape.
5. Formulate questions that can initiate exploratory analysis of an
   unfamiliar dataset.

## Concept Inventory

### EDA vs. CDA (LO 1)

Tukey contrasted EDA with *confirmatory data analysis* (CDA). CDA begins
with a hypothesis and determines whether data support it. EDA begins with
data and asks what patterns might be present. The difference is one of
emphasis, not exclusion: a complete analysis involves both. The student
should understand this as a both/and, not an either/or.

**Key phrase from the text:** EDA is "an emphasis on visualization,
summary, and the iterative development of questions."

### Sample and Population

The chapter frames data as a *sample* from a *population*. This framing
matters because our goal is usually to learn about the population. Even
with complete databases, we can think of observed data as a sample from a
hypothetical population of cases that *could have occurred* under similar
conditions.

### Measures of Central Tendency (LO 2)

- **Mean:** $\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i$.
  Minimizes sum of squared deviations. Sensitive to outliers.
- **Median:** Middle value when sorted. *Resistant* to outliers;
  *robust* for skewed distributions.
- **Mode:** Most frequent value; for continuous data, the peak of a
  density estimate.

### Measures of Dispersion (LO 2)

- **Standard deviation:**
  $s = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}$.
  Sensitive to outliers.
- **IQR:** Q3 − Q1. Measures spread of the middle 50%. Resistant
  to outliers.
- **Range:** Maximum − minimum. Highly sensitive to outliers.

**Choosing between summaries:** For symmetric distributions without
outliers, mean and SD are natural. For skewed distributions or data with
outliers, median and IQR are more stable. Computing *both* and comparing
is itself an EDA technique—a large mean–median discrepancy signals
skewness or outliers.

### Visualization Tools (LOs 3–4)

- **Histogram:** Partitions data into bins, counts per bin. Reveals
  shape, gaps, ties. Choice of binwidth matters.
- **Density plot:** Kernel density estimation (KDE) smooths the
  histogram into a continuous curve. Useful for comparing groups.
- **Scatter plot:** Displays relationship between two numeric variables.
  Transparency (alpha) helps with overplotting.
- **Box plot:** Displays five-number summary (min, Q1, median, Q3, max)
  plus outliers. Effective for comparing distributions across groups.

### Conditional Distributions (LO 4)

The chapter introduces conditional distributions through box plots of
son's height grouped by father's height intervals. This is the visual
precursor to the formal treatment in Chapter 2. The student should
understand that a conditional distribution is "the distribution of Y
given a particular value or range of X."

### Questions Drive the Analysis (LO 5)

The chapter emphasizes that EDA is *question-driven*: the analyst brings
questions to data, and data suggest new questions. Standard starting
points include: What is each variable's distribution? Are there outliers?
Missing values? How are pairs of variables related?

The heuristic the book offers: "What would I need to know to make a
decision or take an action?"

### The Father-Son Height Example

The chapter's extended example uses Pearson's father-son height data
(`UsingR::father.son`, 1,078 pairs). Key findings the student should
be able to articulate:

- Positive association: taller fathers tend to have taller sons.
- The relationship is roughly linear with substantial scatter.
- Sons are on average about 1 inch taller than fathers.
- Conditional distributions (sons' heights given fathers' height intervals)
  are roughly symmetric with similar spread (~2.5–2.8 inches SD).
- Regression to the mean: extreme fathers tend to have less-extreme sons.

### Regression to the Mean

Galton's observation that extreme values tend to be followed by less
extreme values. This is a *statistical* phenomenon arising whenever two
variables are correlated but not perfectly so—not a biological mechanism.
The chapter flags this for formal treatment in Chapter 2.

## Common Misconceptions

<!-- TODO (Tony): Fill in from teaching experience and alpha testing.
     The following are initial candidates; refine, reorder, or replace
     based on what you have actually observed. -->

1. **EDA = data cleaning.** Students may treat EDA as a preprocessing
   step to "get through" before the real work of modeling. Probe: "If
   the data were already clean, would EDA still be useful? Why?"

2. **Visualization as product, not process.** Students may treat plots
   as deliverables rather than thinking tools—making one plot, declaring
   the answer, and moving on. Probe: "What question does this plot
   answer? What question does it raise?"

3. **Mean as default.** Students may compute the mean without considering
   whether it is appropriate. Probe: "What would happen to this summary
   if we added one very extreme value?"

4. **Regression to the mean as causal.** Students may interpret Galton's
   observation as "tall fathers cause shorter sons." Probe: "If we
   instead grouped sons by height and looked at their fathers, what
   would we see?"

5. **EDA feels unrigorous to mathematically trained students.** Students
   with strong math backgrounds may feel that "just looking at data"
   lacks the precision they are accustomed to. This is not a
   misconception to correct but a legitimate tension to acknowledge.
   The EDA tradition asks for a different mode of reasoning than
   deductive proof. Probe: "What can you learn from this plot that
   a formal test would not tell you?"

<!-- TODO (Tony): Any Ch1-specific observations from Aaron/Lynn alpha
     testing? The tone/praise issues are already in the main agent
     prompt; I'm asking about content-level misunderstandings here. -->

## Scaffolding Strategies

<!-- TODO (Tony): For each exercise, what is the productive first
     question when a student is stuck? What hint opens a door without
     giving away the answer? The entries below are starting points
     based on the exercise structure; refine from your experience. -->

### When a student is stuck on data exploration (Exercises 1–2, Problems)

- "What are the first three things you would want to know about a
  dataset you've never seen before?"
- "Before making any plots, what does `str()` or `dplyr::glimpse()`
  tell you?"
- "You have both numeric and categorical variables. How does that
  affect your choice of visualization?"

### When a student is stuck on visualization choice (Exercises 3, 5)

- "What type of variable is on each axis? Does that constrain your
  options?"
- "You've made one plot. What does it show that a different plot type
  would not?"

### When a student is stuck on interpretation (Exercises 4, 7)

- "Describe what you see in the plot before interpreting what it means."
- "If someone who hadn't seen the data asked you to summarize this
  plot in one sentence, what would you say?"

### When a student is stuck on the EDA vs. CDA distinction (Exercise 3)

- "If you already had a specific hypothesis about these data, how
  would your analysis differ from what you just did?"
- "Could this same plot serve both exploratory and confirmatory
  purposes? What would change?"

## Key Connections

**Forward references the student may encounter:**

- *Conditional distributions* → formalized in Chapter 2 (graph of
  averages, regression line, correlation coefficient).
- *Kernel density estimation* → the chapter mentions KDE as a smoothing
  technique; smoothing returns in Chapter 2 when fitting curves to
  scatter plots.
- *Regression to the mean* → mathematical basis developed in Chapter 2.
- *Anscombe's quartet* → Book Exercise 7 hints at this; it is treated
  explicitly in Chapter 2.
- *Choosing among summaries* → the resistance/robustness theme carries
  through to Chapter 4 (simulation: comparing mean vs. median estimators)
  and Chapter 5 (study design: how outliers affect inference).

**If the student asks about topics not yet covered:**

If a student asks about correlation, regression lines, or the formal
meaning of "regression to the mean," acknowledge these are excellent
questions and note that Chapter 2 develops them in detail. Offer to
discuss the intuition visible in Chapter 1's plots without introducing
formulas that belong to Chapter 2.

## Companion Guidance for This Chapter

When helping a student with Chapter 1 material:

- **Anchor in questions, not techniques.** The chapter's central message
  is that EDA is question-driven. If a student jumps to code or plots
  without articulating a question, redirect: "What are you trying to
  learn from this plot?"

- **Use the father-son data as common ground.** Every student has worked
  through this example. When illustrating a point, reference it rather
  than introducing new examples.

- **Watch for premature closure.** A student who makes one plot and
  declares "the data look normal" has not yet internalized the
  exploratory mindset. Probe: "What else might you want to check?"

- **The `summary()` function as entry point.** If a student is unsure
  where to start, `summary()` is always a reasonable first step. But
  ensure they interpret the output rather than just displaying it.

- **Resist the urge to teach Chapter 2.** The father-son example
  naturally invites discussion of correlation and regression. Stay
  within Chapter 1's scope: the visual pattern, the conditional box
  plots, the qualitative observation of regression to the mean. The
  formalization comes next chapter.

- **Respect mathematically trained students' discomfort.** Students
  with strong math backgrounds may find the inductive, open-ended
  nature of EDA frustrating. Acknowledge this tension honestly:
  data analysis asks for a different mode of reasoning than deductive
  proof, and that shift is genuinely challenging. Do not dismiss their
  concern or suggest they simply need to "think differently."

- **Celebrate mathematical exploration.** When a student pursues a
  mathematical calculation to build understanding, this is EDA in the
  Tukey-Brillinger tradition, not a detour from it. A student who
  works through how scaling a variable affects a summary statistic, or
  who derives a property of the mean algebraically to understand its
  sensitivity to outliers, is using mathematics *as* an exploratory
  tool. Encourage this. Do not redirect toward qualitative
  interpretation when the student is productively reasoning through
  the mathematics. This principle becomes even more important in the
  linear algebra chapters (Part 2), but it applies here as well.
